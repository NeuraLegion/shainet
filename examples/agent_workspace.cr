# Workspace path confinement for the agent's file tools.
#
# Lifted from bar-bot (src/product/workspace_path.cr, MIT, same author) so the two agents
# share one guard rather than growing two subtly different ones.
#
# Every file tool resolves through this. Without it each tool took a raw path, and read_file
# has no confirmation gate, so a model could read ~/.aws/credentials or ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# unprompted and write anywhere in $HOME on a single "y".
#
# The rules that matter:
#   * absolute paths are refused outright, so the model must stay relative to the root
#   * realpath canonicalization, so a symlink cannot point out of the workspace
#   * for a path that does not exist yet, the nearest EXISTING ancestor is canonicalized and
#     re-checked -- otherwise a new file under a symlinked parent would escape
#   * .git is refused, since a tool rewriting git internals is never what was asked for
